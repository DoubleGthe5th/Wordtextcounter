# Wordtextcounter
Counts and finds the most common words in a piece of text

The orginal python code was meant to analyze a fanfic made by one of my former discord friends, hence the variable names and the fact that the file to be counted is called "Cheerios.txt"

It also creates a wordcloud, various "stopwords" were added due to filter out common and uninteresting english words.
